가죽을 만들게 된 계기
The paragraph tag has a few basic attributes you should learn about to start with.

id - this has to be unique to the page. An id can be used on multiple pages but only once on a single page.
An id can be used in the stylesheet to set specific formatting to the paragraphs with this id.

class - A class is used to apply styling to the paragraph. It can be applied to many paragraphs on the page or across the whole website.
lang - defines the language used in the paragraph. You would use this if the contents of the paragraph is different from the base language of the web page. e.g. French when the rest of the page is in English.
style - The style attribute is used when you want to apply specific styling to a paragraph.
Novice web page coders and some HTML editors do this when using the design view of the HTML editor like a word processing program. This adds unnecessary coding to the web page as this is a typical styling it can be applied using the stylesheet.

Using the style attribute of the paragraph tag makes it hard to manage the editing of the website because in the future if you want to change the styling you have to hunt down every instance of that inline style in all the pages. This can be quite a bit of work if you have a large site.

We would recommend that you try and avoid using this paragraph tag attribute all together but if you absolutely have to use it, use it very few times.
